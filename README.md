# How to Create a Windows Executable from a Python Script

Turning your Python script into a standalone .exe file is simple with PyInstaller. Follow this guide to generate an executable that can run on Windows without requiring Python installation.
1. Install PyInstaller

First, install PyInstaller if you havenâ€™t already:

'pip install pyinstaller'

2. Convert the Script to an Executable

Run the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

'pyinstaller --onefile --windowed yourscript.py'

Explanation of Flags:

    --onefile: Creates a single executable instead of multiple files.
    --windowed (optional): Hides the console window (useful for GUI applications). Omit this flag for CLI scripts.

3. Find the Executable

After running the command, PyInstaller will generate files in the dist folder. Your .exe will be located at:

'dist/yourscript.exe'

4. Running the Executable

Navigate to the dist folder and run:

'yourscript.exe'

5. (Optional) Add an Icon

If you want to add a custom icon, use:

'pyinstaller --onefile --icon=icon.ico yourscript.py'

Make sure icon.ico is in the same directory as your script.
